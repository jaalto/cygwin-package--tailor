.TH TAILOR "1" "September 2005" "tailor 0.9.16" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
tailor \- tool to keep in sync various kinds of repository
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: tailor [options] [project ...]
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Print each executed command. This also keeps temporary
files with the upstream logs, that are otherwise
removed after use.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose, echoing the changelog of each applied
changeset to stdout.
.TP
\fB\-\-configfile\fR=\fICONFNAME\fR
Centralized storage of projects info.  With this option
and no other arguments tailor will update every project
found in the config file.
.TP
\fB\-\-encoding\fR=\fICHARSET\fR
Force the output encoding to given CHARSET, rather then
using the user's default settings specified in the
environment.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show program's version number and exit
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.SS "Bootstrap options:"
.TP
\fB\-sVC\-KIND\fR, \fB\-\-source\-kind\fR=\fIVC\-KIND\fR
Select the backend for the upstream source version
control VC\-KIND. Default is 'cvs'.
.TP
\fB\-tVC\-KIND\fR, \fB\-\-target\-kind\fR=\fIVC\-KIND\fR
Select VC\-KIND as backend for the shadow repository,
with 'darcs' as default.
.TP
\fB\-RREPOS\fR, \fB\-\-repository\fR=\fIREPOS\fR, \fB\-\-source\-repository\fR=\fIREPOS\fR
Specify the upstream repository, from where bootstrap
will checkout the module.  REPOS syntax depends on the
source version control kind.
.TP
\fB\-mMODULE\fR, \fB\-\-module\fR=\fIMODULE\fR, \fB\-\-source\-module\fR=\fIMODULE\fR
Specify the module to checkout at bootstrap time. This
has different meanings under the various upstream
systems: with CVS it indicates the module, while under
SVN it's the prefix of the tree you want and must begin
with a slash. Since it's used in the description of the
target repository, you may want to give it a value with
darcs too, even though it is otherwise ignored.
.TP
\fB\-rREV\fR, \fB\-\-revision\fR=\fIREV\fR, \fB\-\-start\-revision\fR=\fIREV\fR
Specify the revision bootstrap should checkout.  REV
must be a valid 'name' for a revision in the upstream
version control kind. For CVS it may be either a branch
name, a timestamp or both separated by a space, and
timestamp may be 'INITIAL' to denote the beginning of
time for the given branch. Under Darcs, INITIAL is a
shortcut for the name of the first patch in the
upstream repository, otherwise it is interpreted as the
name of a tag. Under Subversion, 'INITIAL' is the first
patch that touches given repos/module, otherwise it
must be an integer revision number. 'HEAD' means the
latest version in all backends.
.TP
\fB\-TREPOS\fR, \fB\-\-target\-repository\fR=\fIREPOS\fR
Specify the target repository, the one that will
receive the patches coming from the source one.
.TP
\fB\-MMODULE\fR, \fB\-\-target\-module\fR=\fIMODULE\fR
Specify the module on the target repository that will
actually contain the upstream source tree.
.TP
\fB\-\-subdir\fR=\fIDIR\fR
Force the subdirectory where the checkout will happen,
by default it's the tail part of the module name.
.SS "Update options:"
.TP
\fB\-FFORMAT\fR, \fB\-\-patch\-name\-format\fR=\fIFORMAT\fR
Specify the prototype that will be used to compute the
patch name.  The prototype may contain %(keyword)s such
as 'author', 'date', 'revision', 'firstlogline',
\&'remaininglog'. It defaults to 'Tailorized
"%(revision)s"'; setting it to the empty string means
that tailor will simply use the original changelog.
.TP
\fB\-1\fR, \fB\-\-remove\-first\-log\-line\fR
Remove the first line of the upstream changelog. This
is intended to pair with \fB\-\-patch\-name\-format\fR, when
using its 'firstlogline' variable to build the name of
the patch.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-refill\-changelogs\fR
Refill every changelog, useful when upstream logs are
not uniform.
.IP
VC specific options:
.TP
\fB\-\-use\-svn\-propset\fR
Use 'svn propset' to set the real date and author of
each commit, instead of appending these information to
the changelog. This requires some tweaks on the SVN
repository to enable revision propchanges.
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-arch\-ids\fR
Ignore .arch\-ids directories when using a tla source.
